# üßë‚ÄçüíªDevelopment Plan

### Introduction

> The development of Mont Adventures was not just strategically planned but also meticulously tracked. Employing methodologies like Agile and tools like GitHub Kanban, the development process was both flexible and accountable. This section delves into the nitty-gritty of the development roadmap, methodologies, and technologies.

### Research and Initial Decisions

Before the development journey began, a comprehensive research plan was set into motion. This involved:

1. **Competitor Analysis:** Examining websites with similar functionalities to identify their strengths and weaknesses.

2. **Technology Stack Research:** While React was a prevalent choice among competitor websites for front-end development, it was not an option due to a lack of prior knowledge in the framework. Instead, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, and HTMX were chosen to achieve similar front-end features without the need to learn React.

3. **Feature Benchmarking:** Features across different platforms were compared to understand what's essential and what could give Mont Adventures a competitive edge.

4. **User Experience Research:** The user interfaces of competitors were studied to glean best practices and potential areas for innovation.

This robust research plan informed the development strategy, providing clear guidance on the technologies and features to focus on.

### Point System and Estimation

For the first time, the Fabiosci point system was employed to quantify the complexity and time estimation of various tasks. This point system allowed for a more structured allocation of tasks and helped in tracking progress effectively.

- **Epic Points:** Each epic was assigned a certain number of points, indicating its overall complexity and estimated time requirement.

- **User Stories Points:** Points were also allocated to individual user stories, helping in prioritizing and scheduling tasks.

#### 5. **Final Configurations:**

* Link your templates directory in Heroku: `TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates')`.
* Update the templates directory to `TEMPLATES_DIR`: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`.
* Add your Heroku app to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` (format: `app_name.herokuapp.com`).
* Create three top-level directories in your project: `media`, `static`, `templates`.
* Add a `Procfile` at the top level and write: `web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi`.
* Commit and push your changes to GitHub.

#### 6. **Deploy on Heroku:**

* In Heroku, go to the 'Deploy' tab.
* Deploy the branch manually and monitor the build logs for any issues.
* Once the build completes, you'll see a success message and a link to view the live site.

> **Note**: Replace placeholders like `<your_database_url_from_heroku>`, `<your_secret_key>`, `<PROJECT_NAME>` with actual values relevant to your project.
